In the realm of web development, efficiency and organization reign supreme. Monorepos, a concept housing multiple projects within a single codebase, offer a compelling solution for streamlining development workflows. This blog delves into crafting a robust monorepo using Turborepo, NestJS for the backend, and Next.js for the frontend, empowering you to build fullstack applications seamlessly.

## Why Monorepo?

Imagine managing separate repositories for your frontend (Next.js) and backend (NestJS) code. Updates, bug fixes, and version control become a juggling act. Monorepos eliminate this chaos by uniting both projects under one roof. Benefits include:

- Simplified dependency management
- Streamlined development
- Improved code consistency
- Enhanced collaboration

## Enter Turborepo: The Monorepo Maestro

Turborepo, a next-generation monorepo tool, takes center stage. Its lightning-fast build speeds and intuitive workflow make it a perfect choice for our project. Here's what Turborepo brings to the table:

- Cache invalidation
- Flexible project structure
- Seamless integration

## Building the Monorepo

- 1. Project Setup:

```jsx
npx create-turbo@latest my-turborepo-project
```

You will be prompted with choose your workspace choose anyone you prefer for this demo I am using npm workspaces

```jsx
npm workspaces
yarn workspaces
pnpm workspaces
```

After choosing `npm workspaces` installation will begin it will take sometime your project will look like below.

```jsx
turbo.json
tsconfig.json
README.md
packages
apps
package-lock.json
node_modules
package.json
```

- 2. Nextjs Frontend:

Go in the `apps` folder you will see 2 folders docs and web. These folders contain your frontend application.

```jsx
cd ./apps
```

```jsx
web
docs
```

You can go inside the folder and modify things it is a normal Nextjs application.

- 3. Nestjs Backend:

To create a nestjs backend in turborepo make a folder called api(you can name it anything) inside the apps folder.

```jsx
mkdir api
cd api
```

Once the folder is created run below command to generate a new nestjs project.

```jsx
nest new ./
```

Use `npm` as your dependency manager.

- 3. Running the project

After creating the api folder come the root of the project open the `package.json` file.

```jsx
"scripts": {
    "build": "turbo build",
    "dev": "turbo dev",
    "lint": "turbo lint",
    "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.{ts,tsx,md}\""
  },
```

You will see `dev` which runs `turbo dev`. Turbo dev will go inside each project inside apps and run there dev scripts.

Now run the project

```jsx
#run from the root of the project
npm run dev
```

You will see the logs generated in your console.

But wait where is the Nestjs logs. We will see in next part.

- 4. Fixing the Nestjs dev scripts.

As stated earlier the `turbo dev` script will go inside every projetc inside apps and run there dev script. But there
is no `dev` script inside the `package.json` file of nestjs project. There is `start:dev` which turbo repo cannot understand.

```jsx
"scripts": {
    "build": "nest build",
    "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.ts\" \"test/**/*.ts\"",
    "start": "nest start",
    "start:dev": "nest start --watch",
    "start:debug": "nest start --debug --watch",
    "start:prod": "node dist/main",
    "lint": "eslint \"{src,apps,libs,test}/**/*.ts\" --fix",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:cov": "jest --coverage",
    "test:debug": "node --inspect-brk -r tsconfig-paths/register -r ts-node/register node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand",
    "test:e2e": "jest --config ./test/jest-e2e.json"
  },
```

For turborepo to work you need to change the `start:dev` to `dev`.

```jsx
"scripts": {
    "build": "nest build",
    "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.ts\" \"test/**/*.ts\"",
    "start": "nest start",
    "dev": "nest start --watch",
    "start:debug": "nest start --debug --watch",
    "start:prod": "node dist/main",
    "lint": "eslint \"{src,apps,libs,test}/**/*.ts\" --fix",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:cov": "jest --coverage",
    "test:debug": "node --inspect-brk -r tsconfig-paths/register -r ts-node/register node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand",
    "test:e2e": "jest --config ./test/jest-e2e.json"
  },
```

Also by default the Nestjs project runs on port 3000 which needs to change.

Go inside `/apps/api/src` open `main.ts` file and change the port to 3456.

```js
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(3456);
}
bootstrap();
```

We are all set now again go to the root of the project and run

```
npm run dev
```

You project will start and you will similar logs in your console.

```logs

## Conclusion
By leveraging Turborepo, NestJS, and Next.js in a monorepo setup, you gain a powerful foundation for building fullstack applications. This approach fosters efficiency, collaboration, and code maintainability, propelling your development efforts to new heights.
