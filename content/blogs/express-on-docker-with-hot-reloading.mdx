## Creating a Hot Reloading Feature in Docker Images for Node.js Express Applications

In this blog post, we will learn how to create a hot reloading feature in Docker images for a Node.js Express application. This feature is incredibly useful during the development phase as it allows your application to automatically restart whenever a file is changed.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

  - Node.js
  - Docker Desktop


## Project Setup

Initialize a node project

```js:fancyAlert.js
npm init -y
```

Install express and nodemon

```js:fancyAlert.js
npm i express
```

```js:fancyAlert.js
npm i -D nodemon
```

Our `package.json` file looks like this:

```jsx
{
  "name": "docker-hot-reload",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.19.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.0"
  }
}
```

Create a `src` folder and a file `index.js` and write the below code

```jsx
// ./src/index.js

import express from 'express';

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "From server using nodemon docker" })
})

app.listen(6969, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 6969')
})
```

## Dockerfile
Our Dockerfile is responsible for creating a Docker image of our application:

```jsx
FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

USER node

EXPOSE 6969

CMD [ "node", "./src/index.js" ]
```

## Docker Compose

We use Docker Compose to define and run our applicationâ€™s services:

```jsx
version: '3.9'
services:
  express:
    build: 
      context: ./
    ports:
      - '6969:6969'
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app
      - /usr/src/app/node_modules
    command:
      - npm
      - run
      - dev
```

##  Hot Reloading

The magic of hot reloading happens thanks to `nodemon` and Docker volumes. `nodemon` is a utility that monitors for any changes in your source code and automatically restarts your server. Docker volumes allow us to map a directory on our host machine to a directory in our Docker container. This means that when we make a change to our source code on our host machine, those changes are reflected in our Docker container. When `nodemon` detects these changes, it restarts our server, thus achieving hot reloading.
